# Code Fellows App-A-Day: Lunch Tracker

## This is a simple lunch journal to keep track of the meals you eat each day.

## To add a new meal to your tracker, just select "New Lunch" at the bottom of the homepage. This will bring you to a new page where you can input your lunch information.

### Add your meal! It's easy!  
  1. Select the date from the drop down menu. (Remember: _30 days has September, April, June, November. All the rest have 31, except for February, which has 28. Unless it's leap year. And the next one isn't until 2016._)  
  2. Enter what you ate in the "Food" field  
  3. Enter the number of calories by typing in the number or using the up and down arrows on the right of the "Calories" field.  
  4. Check whether or not the meal was delicious. (If it was not delicious, do *NOT* check the box!)  
  5. Click the "Create Lunch" button when you're ready to add your lunch to the tracker!  

If something doesn't work, you can contact Stephanie Datu at stephdatu@gmail.com and complain.
